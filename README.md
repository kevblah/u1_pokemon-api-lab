This is a Pokédex application designed to resemble the Instagram interface on a mobile device. It allows users to search for Pokémon and view their profiles.

## How to Use

1. Open the Pokédex in your web browser.
2. The interface is divided into two pages: Explore and Profile.
3. Explore Page:
   - Displays a grid of random dog pictures.
   - To switch to the Profile Page, enter a Pokémon name in the search field and press Enter.
4. Profile Page:
   - Shows the profile of the searched Pokémon.
   - Includes the Pokémon's name, description, and profile picture.
   - Each profile grid displays a random Pokémon image and background.
   - To switch back to the Explore Page, click the search button at the bottom.
5. The Pokédex retrieves data from the PokeAPI to populate the profiles and generate random images and backgrounds.
